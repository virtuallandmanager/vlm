## Management and access control

The management HUD and all scene-changing messages now require a signed-in, verified user with permission for that scene. Visitors still receive scene updates. Clients receive `auth_status`, `venue_access` and `access_revoked` messages, and `virvi_error { code, messageType }` when a message is rejected. The error codes are:

- `forbidden` — the user lacks permission for the requested action
- `not_found` — the requested scene or resource does not exist
- `server_error` — the handler threw an unhandled exception

## Moving things in-world

Editors can move, rotate and resize placed models, images, screens and sounds without leaving Decentraland.

Open the Layout panel and press **Edit layout**. The button shows for editors, cohosts and hosts. Venue renters (and the crew they invite) never see it. Items have to be visible (synced) in your scene before you can edit them.

Click an item to select it, then pick a mode on the bar:

- **Move:** click and drag. The item lands where your pointer hits the scene. Tap **Shift** to cycle Free, X, Y, Z, then back to Free. The locked axis shows as a guide line (red for X, green for Y, blue for Z) and follows the scene's axes.
- **Rotate:** drag one of three rings. Hold **Shift** to turn in 15° steps.
- **Resize:** drag the corner handle to scale evenly, or an axis handle to stretch one way. The handles turn with the item, so a handle always stretches along the item's own side, even on a tilted screen. Images and screens are flat, so they have no depth handle. Hold **Shift** to snap (the corner in 10% steps, an axis handle in 0.25 m steps).

Changes are drafts until you press **Save**. Save stores them to the live preset only; the bar shows **Saving…** until the server confirms. If the save fails, or you're disconnected, the bar says so and your change stays as a draft so you can try again. **Revert** puts the item back. If you press **Done** with unsaved changes, you are asked what to do first.

While you hold an item, other editors see "being moved by" and your name on it and can't grab it until you save or revert. Visitors only ever see saved changes.

@virvixr/dcl needs Decentraland SDK 7.26 or newer (Shift was added in 7.23; the HUD's high-DPI scaling is reliable from 7.26).

## Uploading from in-world

Editors can add images and GLB models to the scene's Media Library while standing in it.

Open the Media Library panel and press **Upload**. The panel shows:

- **Open on this computer:** opens the upload page in your browser. Decentraland asks you to confirm opening the link.
- **A QR code:** scan it with your phone to upload a photo from your camera roll.
- **The link and a 6-character code**, in case you'd rather type it in.

Each link lasts 30 minutes and allows 10 uploads. Press **New link** for a fresh one. Only you can see the code; it's drawn in your own HUD, never in the scene. The link can only upload files to this scene's library. It doesn't sign anyone in.

Uploads appear in the Media Library straight away, newest first, with a status:

- **• Uploading / • Processing:** the file is on its way.
- **✓ Available:** ready to **Place**.
- **⟳ Needs sync:** a model you've placed that won't show until you run `npx @virvixr/dcl sync` and redeploy the scene. Models only render once they're deployed with the scene.
- **✕ Failed:** the reason is shown, for example when a file is too big. Press **Dismiss** to clear it.

Images can be up to 10 MB and models up to 50 MB. An editor's uploads count against the scene owner's storage. iPhone HEIC photos are usually converted to JPEG automatically; if one isn't, choose a JPEG or PNG instead.
